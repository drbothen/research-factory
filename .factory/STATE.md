# STATE — research-factory engine (self-dogfooded build state)

**The one file to read to resume.** Authoritative, versioned, in-repo. Pairs with `BUILD-PLAN.md`
(the design) and `git log` (the artifacts). My machine-local memory is only a pointer to this.

Last updated: 2026-05-31.

## Current phase

**v0.8 COMPLETE.** Next: **v0.9 — PM pipeline** (pm-doc-chain + pm-doc-writer + pm-process templates:
concept → 6-pager → PRD → user-stories → acceptance-plan).

## Roadmap status (BUILD-PLAN §15)

| Phase | Status | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---|
| P0 — prerequisites | ✅ done | 3 vendor keys validated in hello-world Action; secrets hygiene |
| v0.1 — engine skeleton + OT instance | ✅ done | require-citation hook proven headless; build-track → adversary PASS on one track; config loader |
| v0.5 — L1→L5 pipeline | ✅ done | L3→L4 synth → adversary PASS; L5 judgment through human gate (REVISE×3→PASS); 34 bats green |
| v0.8 — Actions autonomy + /init-market | ✅ done | live night-shift run → **PR #1** (real fixes, autonomy 3); Codex+Gemini review green; /init-market throwaway scaffold |
| v0.9 — PM pipeline | ⬜ next | a selected finding → dev-ready PRD + stories passing the readiness check |
| v1.0 — portfolio (L6) + 2nd market + marketplace publish | ⬜ | 2nd market to Beta from cold seed; L6 brief; engine version-bump propagation |

## Repos

| Repo | Role | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `drbothen/research-factory` | the engine (this repo) | **public** (so instances clone the marketplace) |
| `drbothen/research-factory-template` | thin instance starter (`gh repo create --template`) | private |
| `1898andCo/ot-ics-research` | instance #1 — OT/ICS, the **canonical** OT corpus | private |

## Deployment fixes baked into the Action templates (so the next market just works)

The v0.8 live shakedown surfaced these; all corrected in `templates/github-action-templates/`:
1. Org must **enable GitHub Actions** for the instance repo (org-admin).
2. Builder workflows need `permissions: id-token: write` (claude-code-action OIDC).
3. The **Claude GitHub App** must be installed on the org (it has `workflows:write`). Do NOT override
   auth with `github_token` — GITHUB_TOKEN can't push `.github/workflows/` changes, and PRs it opens
   don't trigger `on-pr-review`. Use the App token (omit `github_token`).
4. `plugin_marketplaces` needs the full `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git` URL (`.git` suffix).
5. claude-code-action only **pushes a branch**; it never opens a PR — open it explicitly.
6. Its `branch_name` output is **empty when Claude pushes via Bash** — detect the `claude/*` branch instead.
7. Engine repo must be **public** for the marketplace clone (scrub any secrets from history first — we used filter-repo).
8. Codex review of a bot PR needs `allow-bots: true` + `allow-bot-users: "claude[bot]"`.
9. Gemini needs env `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` (headless trust).
10. Gemini `gemini_model` must be UNSET or a **valid** generateContent model (`gemini-3-pro` is NOT valid).

Audit: every builder run uploads the `claude-execution-log` artifact (`execution_file`). `show_full_output`
stays OFF (it echoes tool results incl. secrets into the log).

## Open items (not blockers)

- **build-track iteration cap (v0.9 refinement):** the adversary loop has no cap → runs away (50+ min, no
  convergence) on a heavily-flawed draft, so it never commits. Add a max-N-passes cap → commit-what-it-has +
  open a PR flagged "did not fully converge, M MUST-FIX remain."
- **on-pr-review comment posting unverified:** reviewers run green but post 0 comments — likely because
  build-track already converged the PR to 0 MUST-FIX; verify by running on-pr-review against a deliberately-
  flawed PR.

## Decisions log

- 2026-05-31: `1898andCo/ot-ics-research` is the **canonical** OT corpus (cutover; old ai-knowledge-base →
  ot-security-research mirror chain is legacy).
- 2026-05-31: engine repo made **public**; secret fragment scrubbed from history before publishing.
- 2026-05-31: **researcher prefers MCP search** (Perplexity/Tavily), built-in WebSearch/WebFetch fallback.
- 2026-05-31: **never cancel an in-flight paid run without asking** (operator rule).

## How to resume

1. Read this file + `BUILD-PLAN.md` §15 (roadmap) and §1 (constitution).
2. `git log --oneline` here for the artifact trail; `gh pr view 1 --repo 1898andCo/ot-ics-research` for the live proof.
3. Pick up at the **Current phase** above. For v0.9, see BUILD-PLAN §4 (PM pipeline) + §9 (`pm-doc-chain.lobster`).
